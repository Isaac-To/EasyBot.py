## Ready to start running your own Discord Bot?

Do it Easy, Beautiful, Modular, and Fast with EasyBot.py

### EasyBot.py is the easy to use framework for people to develop new commands and set up bots with speed

EasyBot.py has a commands programmer for first time bot makers so they can set up simple commands to interact with their patrons! While you're developing, just use the restart command to restart the bot without having to close the entire process!

### EasyBot.py is simple and beautiful

EasyBot.py strives to bring a beautiful experience to your users so that they will always get a great looking bot. We use embeds with fun colors on every output so it's always colorful and fun.

### EasyBot.py helps your bot succeed

EasyBot.py contains commands built specifically for Bot Admins who do not wish to verify their IDs with Discord. EasyBot.py can use multiple tokens for the exact same experience across all of them so that there's always space for every server. You also get tips on how to grow your bot and tools to prune out smaller servers so that you have space for larger ones!

### EasyBot.py is modular

Want to add more features? Just drag and drop a discord.py cog file into the cogs folder! And if you don't like it? Delete the file and restart! Additionally, we now offer individual cog setups per bot so that you can run multiple bots with completely different setups but run and managed by EasyBot on the same server.

### Did you need speed?

EasyBot is designed to be LIGHTWEIGHT and runs on a mere 26mb (without external plugins) of ram! It also runs every bot token on a different process so that you can take advantage of multicored systems to keep things fast

### There's nothing you need to know

Just drag a plugin into cogs and run eb_launcher.py with a double click. Then just follow the instructions on the command line to start!
