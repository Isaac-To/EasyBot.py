# Easy-Bot.py
**Easy-Bot.py is a simple and no fuss discord bot starter kit** that you can set up **without** any code. Just drag and drop whatever you want and Easy-Bot.py will try it's best to run it! Easy-Bot's set up is simple with a basic gui that stores the discord token and prefix all so you don't have to!

## INSTALL STEPS
Easy-Bot.py REQUIRES PYTHON 3.6+ to be installed (DEVELOPED ON PYTHON 3.9).

Everything else is handled by Easy-Bot! All libaries you need to do is to run are installed by start.bat and will be completely handled **automatically** (unless a plugin requires a specific library to function which you can add to start.bat)!

If not on a windows machine, rename start.bat to start.sh and everything should work as expected!

## HOW TO USE
**To start the bot**
Just run start.bat

**To install a plugin**
To install a plugin, simply drag the .py file into the cogs folder and the bot will attempt to run it on the next boot!
A premade plugin called chess.py is availible by default. This is based on the Sunfish engine and is adapted to discord use by chisaku-dev.
**"Official" plugins can be found by looking at my other repositories that are labeled "Easy-Bot".**
