# Easy-Bot.py
Easy-Bot.py REQUIRES PYTHON to be installed.

Everything is handled by Easy-Bot! All you need to do is to run start.bat and the rest will be completely handled by the program!
If not on a windows machine, rename start.bat to start.sh and everything should work as expected!

To install a plugin, simply drag the .py file into the cogs folder and the bot will attempt to run it on the next boot!
A premade plugin called chess.py is availible by default. This is based on the Sunfish engine and is adapted to discord use by chisaku-dev.

By using this program, you hereby agree to the terms of the license agreement.
