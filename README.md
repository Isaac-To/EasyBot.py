# Easy-Bot.py

**Easy-Bot.py is a simple and no fuss discord bot starter kit** that you can set up **without** any code. Just drag and drop whatever you want and Easy-Bot.py will try it's best to run it! Easy-Bot's set up is simple with a basic gui that stores the discord token and prefix all so you don't have to!

## INSTALL STEPS

Easy-Bot.py REQUIRES PYTHON 3.6+ to be installed (DEVELOPED ON PYTHON 3.9).

The only library this uses is the Discord Library (install this with pip install discord)

## HOW TO USE

### To start the bot

Just execute easybotlauncher.py with python3 easybotlauncher.py or python easybotlauncher depending on your system!

### To install a plugin

To install a plugin, simply drag the .py file into the cogs folder and the bot will attempt to run it on the next boot!
A premade plugin called chess.py is available by default. This is based on the Sunfish engine and is adapted to discord use by chisaku-dev.
**"Official" plugins can be found by looking at my other repositories that are labeled "Easy-Bot".**

### To remove a plugin

Just drag/delete the plugin's .py file out of the cogs folder and it will not be loaded up upon the next boot!
