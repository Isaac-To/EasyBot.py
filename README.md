# Easy-Bot.py
Easy-Bot.py REQUIRES PYTHON to be installed.

Everything is handled by Easy-Bot! All you need to do is to run start.bat and the rest will be completely handeled by the program!
If not on a windows machine, rename start.bat to start.sh and everything should work as expected!

To install a plugin, simply drag the .py file into the cogs folder and the bot will automatically start running it on boot!

By using this program, you hereby agree to the terms of the license agreement.
